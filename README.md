WIF3003 Assignment

This README is written for team members. 

## Requirements  
* Java
* Netbeans 8.0.2 IDE
* Any CLI to run git commands (eg: Git Bash or UBuntu, Windows CMD is not recommended)

## Steps to clone git
1. Ensure your CLI is connected to your GitHub account. [Guide here](https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent)
2. Navigate to your desired directory. Eg: `cd 'Netbeans Projects' `
3. Type this into your terminal:<br>
`git clone https://github.com/sbrnmrzk/conqueringNodes.git`
4. (Optional step) Instead of having to login everytime you want to pull/push code, enter this command line to register your computer: <br>
`git remote set-url origin git@github.com:sbrnmrzk/conqueringNodes.git`

You're all set! :)

Tip: Create a branch from master before starting development to minimize conflicts. After pushing your branch, remember to create a pull request from the main page.
